# Oval Engine
a small rendering engine based on DirectX11 and C++.

## Feature:
1. DirectX11 rendering framework.
2. GPU voxelization and visualization.
3. voxel-based global illumination : voxel cone tracing
4. BRDF material and point light
5. cartoon shading


## Problem:
1. redundant data transmission.
2. specular cone tracing.
3. cone tracing offset. 

Use AntTweakBar and TinyObj as third party.
